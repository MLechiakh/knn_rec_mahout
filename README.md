Hi! 
I've used apache mahout(in the mr package) in this project to perform the tasks that I'll explain them in the following : 
### 1_ Computing: Precision@, Recall@, RMSE and MAE of recomendations computed by Mahout BruteForce algorithm :

To accomplish that with mahout, we're going to create a user-based recommender that uses the `NearestNUserNeighborhood` class from the `org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.neighborhood` package
that is exactly a Brute force computation of the K-NN graph( the k is the N : neighborhood size) to make recommendation: 	

```
UserNeighborhood neighborhood= new NearestNUserNeighborhood(k, similarity, fold.getTraining()) ;
```

For finding similar users, I've used Jaccard similarity by creating AbstractUserSimilarity in the package `org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.similarity` that implements `UserSimilarity` interface,
then I created in the same package `JaccardUserSimilarity` class that extends `AbstractUserSimilarity` in which I overrided the `userSimilarity(long userID1, long userID2)` method to compute
Jaccard similarity between tow users respecting the threshold fixed by the contstructor of the class, then we invoke the class by : 

```
 UserSimilarity similarity = new JaccardUserSimilarity(fold.getTraining(), threshold) ;
```

Now, we have all the pieces to create our recommender, we do that in the class `MyRecommenderBuilder1` in the `packge org.apache.main` using the buildRecommender function:

```
public Recommender buildRecommender(DataModel dataModel, Fold fold) throws TasteException {
		UserSimilarity similarity = new JaccardUserSimilarity(fold.getTraining(), threshold) ;
		UserNeighborhood neighborhood= new NearestNUserNeighborhood(k, similarity, fold.getTraining()) ;
		UserBasedRecommender recommender = new GenericUserBasedRecommender(dataModel, neighborhood, similarity);
		return recommender;
  
	}
```
	
then we evaluate this recommender in `MainBruteForce` class in the same package main :

```

DataModel model = new FileDataModel(new File(rootPath+"\\Datasets\\"+fileName+".csv")); // to load the dataset
RecommenderBuilder builder = new MyRecommenderBuilder1(model,threshold, k); // invoke the recommender we've just build it

// to calculate Precision@ and Recall@
KFoldRecommenderIRStatsEvaluator evaluatorIRStats = new KFoldRecommenderIRStatsEvaluator(model, 5); /* 5-fold cross-validation */
IRStatistics irstats = evaluatorIRStats.evaluate(builder, number_rec, threshold);
System.out.println("Precision: "+irstats.getPrecision() + "Recall: "+irstats.getRecall());

// to calculate RMSE and MAE
KFoldRecommenderPredictionEvaluator evaluatorPred = new KFoldRecommenderPredictionEvaluator(model, 5);
PredictionStatistics prestats = evaluatorPred.evaluate(builder) ;
System.out.println("MAE= "+prestats.getMAE()+"RMSE= "+prestats.getRMSE());
```

### 2_ Computing Precision@, Recall@, RMSE and MAE of recomendations using Mahout based on KNN files generated independently by python project:

Let's have the figure mentioned in this link : [Program description](https://gitlab.inria.fr/mlechiak/knn_recommendation_mahout/blob/master/project_description.jpg),
It explains how we have used Mahout framework to accomplish the tasks involved in the title of this section.
Firstly, let's describe the code's operation :

*  Data preparation and spliting :

The program read the dataset file and convert it to a CSV format if it has not been already done, and as we perform a 5-cross validation, the program creates at each iteration 
a training set and test set files in Datasets folder, these tasks are performed by `buildTest` and `buildTrain` function in `MyRecommenderBuilder` class in the `packge org.apache.main`

*  Use of Python project and creation of the LBNN graph file(KNN graph)

The program generates the KNN graph file(named LBNN graph) using the Traing set file by launching the python script which responsable on excuting the algorithm and storing 
the result(LBNN graph) as a JSON file called **KNNG_LBNN**.txt whose its path is specified in **config.properties** file, the function that  lunches this script is `runScript`
in `MyRecommenderBuilder` class.


*  Create the recommender based on the LBNN graph file

Now, we compute the neighborhood and the similarities for every users based on the LBNN graph generated by the python script, I use for that the `UserNeighborhoodImpl` class 
that implements the `UserNeighborhood` interface and `UserSimilarityIml` that implements the 'UserSimilarity' interface, then we build our recommender in the `buildRecommender`
function in the `MyRecommenderBuilder` class :
```
  
		UserNeighborhood neighborhood= new UserNeighborhoodImpl(p.getJsonObject()) ;
		UserSimilarity similarity = new UserSimilarityIml(p.getJsonObject()) ;
		UserBasedRecommender recommender = new GenericUserBasedRecommender(dataModel, neighborhood, similarity);
```

*   Finally, 

The Main class binds all the previous class and it calls the functions to make the calculations for either the Recall and Precision or the RMSE and MAE.

Note that the configuration made for this project is supposed to run on a unix OS, if you want to run you experiments in a windows os, you should modify the Paths in Main.java
MainBruteForce.java and **MyRecommenderBuilder.java** to math the windows environment (change / by \\ for example: /Datasets/ by \\Datasets\\), then export the jar files with this 
new configurations.

For Tests on servers or if you want to run these tow functionalities(1 and 2) explained obove with a jar executable, you can use **bf_mahout** jar file for the Brute force related
experiments(point 1) and the **lbnn_mahout** jar file for the LBNNG related experiments(point 2).

You first should create the **Datasets** and **Logs** folders and put the **config.properties** file
in the same location with the jar files, you can modify the paths in config.properties to match your environment structure.

Then, you should have a java development environment in you system, so you can set up the   [Java SE Development Kit 8 ](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
or its recent versions. you should also set up  [python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) to run the experiments with lbnn approache.

#### bf_mahout.jar

you can run  **bf_mahout** by this command : 
> java -jar bf_mahout.jar DataSetName accuracy||error K(size of neighborhood) threshold (nbr_recommendation)+  

Let's see this example: `java -jar bf_mahout.jar TestSet0 accuracy 50 3 10 20 30`
So, we have chosen the accuracy measures(to compute Recall and Precision), K=50, threshold=3 and we will make 3 experiments for three numbers of recommendations:  10, 20 and 30(you can specify the numbers you want)

#### lbnn_mahout.jar
The command here is as follows: 
**lbnn_mahout** by this command : 
> java -jar lbnn_mahout.jar DataSetName accuracy||error  threshold  graph_learning||sym_graph_learning (nbr_recommendation)+  

for example `java -jar lbnn_mahout.jar DataSetName error 3  graph_learning 12 20 30 40 `
graph_learning and sym_graph_learning are the python executables present in the path:  `/py_scripts/dist/`

Welcome to Apache Mahout!
===========
The Apache Mahoutâ„¢ project's goal is to build an environment for quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.

For additional information about Mahout, visit the [Mahout Home Page](http://mahout.apache.org/)

#### Setting up your Environment
Whether you are using Mahout's Shell, running command line jobs or using it as a library to build your own apps you'll need to setup several environment variables. Edit your environment in `~/.bash_profile` for Mac or `~/.bashrc` for many linux distributions. Add the following
```
export MAHOUT_HOME=/path/to/mahout
export MAHOUT_LOCAL=true # for running standalone on your dev machine, 
# unset MAHOUT_LOCAL for running on a cluster
```
You will need a `$JAVA_HOME`, and if you are running on Spark, you will also need `$SPARK_HOME`

#### Using Mahout as a Library
Running any application that uses Mahout will require installing a binary or source version and setting the environment.
To compile from source:
* `mvn -DskipTests clean install`
* To run tests do `mvn test`
* To set up your IDE, do `mvn eclipse:eclipse` or `mvn idea:idea`

To use maven, add the appropriate setting to your pom.xml or build.sbt following the template below.


To use the Samsara environment you'll need to include both the engine neutral math-scala dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.mahout</groupId>
    <artifactId>mahout-math-scala_2.10</artifactId>
    <version>${mahout.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
and a dependency for back end engine translation, e.g:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.mahout</groupId>
    <artifactId>mahout-spark_2.10</artifactId>
    <version>${mahout.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
#### Building From Source

###### Prerequisites:

Linux Environment (preferably Ubuntu 16.04.x) Note: Currently only the JVM-only build will work on a Mac.
gcc > 4.x
NVIDIA Card (installed with OpenCL drivers alongside usual GPU drivers)

###### Downloads

Install java 1.7+ in an easily accessible directory (for this example,  ~/java/)
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
    
Create a directory ~/apache/ .
    
Download apache Maven 3.3.9 and un-tar/gunzip to ~/apache/apache-maven-3.3.9/ .
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
        
Download and un-tar/gunzip Hadoop 2.4.1 to ~/apache/hadoop-2.4.1/ .
https://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.4.1/    

Download and un-tar/gunzip spark-1.6.3-bin-hadoop2.4 to  ~/apache/ .
http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
Choose release: Spark-1.6.3 (Nov 07 2016)
Choose package type: Pre-Built for Hadoop 2.4

Install ViennaCL 1.7.0+
If running Ubuntu 16.04+

```
sudo apt-get install libviennacl-dev
```

Otherwise if your distributionâ€™s package manager does not have a viennniacl-dev package >1.7.0, clone it directly into the directory which will be included in when  being compiled by Mahout:

```
mkdir ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp && git clone https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev.git
cp -r viennacl/ /usr/local/
cp -r CL/ /usr/local/
```

Ensure that the OpenCL 1.2+ drivers are installed (packed with most consumer grade NVIDIA drivers).  Not sure about higher end cards.

Clone mahout repository into `~/apache`.

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/mahout.git
```

###### Configuration

When building mahout for a spark backend, we need four System Environment variables set:
```
    export MAHOUT_HOME=/home/<user>/apache/mahout
    export HADOOP_HOME=/home/<user>/apache/hadoop-2.4.1
    export SPARK_HOME=/home/<user>/apache/spark-1.6.3-bin-hadoop2.4    
    export JAVA_HOME=/home/<user>/java/jdk-1.8.121
```

Mahout on Spark regularly uses one more env variable, the IP of the Spark clusterâ€™s master node (usually the node which one would be logged into).

To use 4 local cores (Spark master need not be running)
```
export MASTER=local[4]
```
To use all available local cores (again, Spark master need not be running)
```
export MASTER=local[*]
```
To point to a cluster with spark running: 
```
export MASTER=spark://master.ip.address:7077
```

We then add these to the path:

```
   PATH=$PATH$:MAHOUT_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$SPARK_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

These should be added to the your ~/.bashrc file.


###### Building Mahout with Apache Maven

Currently Mahout has 3 builds.  From the  $MAHOUT_HOME directory we may issue the commands to build each using mvn profiles.

JVM only:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

JVM with native OpenMP level 2 and level 3 matrix/vector Multiplication
```
mvn clean install -Pviennacl-omp -Phadoop2 -DskipTests
```
JVM with native OpenMP and OpenCL for Level 2 and level 3 matrix/vector Multiplication.  (GPU errors fall back to OpenMP, currently only a single GPU/node is supported).
```
mvn clean install -Pviennacl -Phadoop2 -DskipTests
```

#### Testing the Mahout Environment

Mahout provides an extension to the spark-shell, which is good for getting to know the language, testing partition loads, prototyping algorithms, etc..

To launch the shell in local mode with 2 threads: simply do the following:
```
$ MASTER=local[2] mahout spark-shell
```

After a very verbose startup, a Mahout welcome screen will appear:

```
Loading /home/andy/sandbox/apache-mahout-distribution-0.13.0/bin/load-shell.scala...

That file does not exist


scala>
```
At the scala> prompt, enter: 
```   
scala> :load /home/<andy>/apache/mahout/examples
                               /bin/SparseSparseDrmTimer.mscala
```
Which will load a matrix multiplication timer function definition. To run the matrix timer: 
```
        scala> timeSparseDRMMMul(1000,1000,1000,1,.02,1234L)
            {...} res3: Long = 16321
```
We can see that the JVM only version is rather slow, thus our motive for GPU and Native Multithreading support.

To get an idea of whatâ€™s going on under the hood of the timer, we may examine the .mscala (mahout scala) code which is both fully functional scala and the Mahout R-Like DSL for tensor algebra:    
```



def timeSparseDRMMMul(m: Int, n: Int, s: Int, para: Int, pctDense: Double = .20, seed: Long = 1234L): Long = {
  val drmA = drmParallelizeEmpty(m , s, para).mapBlock(){
       case (keys,block:Matrix) =>
           val R =  scala.util.Random
           R.setSeed(seed)
           val blockB = new SparseRowMatrix(block.nrow, block.ncol)
           blockB := {x => if (R.nextDouble < pctDense) R.nextDouble else x }
       (keys -> blockB)
  }

  val drmB = drmParallelizeEmpty(s , n, para).mapBlock(){
       case (keys,block:Matrix) =>
           val R =  scala.util.Random
           R.setSeed(seed + 1)
           val blockB = new SparseRowMatrix(block.nrow, block.ncol)
           blockB := {x => if (R.nextDouble < pctDense) R.nextDouble else x }
       (keys -> blockB)
  }

  var time = System.currentTimeMillis()

  val drmC = drmA %*% drmB
 
  // trigger computation
  drmC.numRows()

  time = System.currentTimeMillis() - time

  time  
 
}
```
